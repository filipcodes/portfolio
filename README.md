# Developer Portfolio

Developed this portfolio to help showcase my work before getting a job. Added a headless CMS to ease the process of adding projects to it. Once I got an actual job, the portfolio's value has decreased, hence I stopped maintaining it. You can still find the live version on [this web](https://filipsipos.netlify.app/).
